# AWS FFMPEG Converter

## Introduction
Hello! This is my first independent AWS CloudFormation / IaC project. In full working form, it will launch a web page to upload videos, convert those videos to configured qualities, then present them back to the user on that same web page.

I will upload each stage of the project as its own verson. This readme will provide descriptions of the infrastructure of the specific versions, each one building on the last. Once I complete the project, I will provide a full, ground-up description of the final version so that readers do not have to go through all previous versions.

## Versions
